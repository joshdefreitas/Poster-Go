Physical Posters is an old but still widely used way for advertising. Our idea is to enhance the experience of posters with augmented reality technology. Utilizing Google ARCore, when the users point their phones’ cameras to physical posters, the app allows users to see virtual panels displaying pictures, videos, websites and others’ comments, and even “Harry Potter style” moving posters. 

## Features
The following are a list of proposed features for the project that uses external services and real-time updates.

### Google ARCore:
Detect physical posters
Motion tracking
Add virtual panels 

### Database:
Comments
Images
Videos and websites added by the owner of the poster


### Bonus:
Searching database based on geographic location to improve performance
